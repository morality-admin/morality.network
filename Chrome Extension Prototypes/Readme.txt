Version 1: Had major issues in that the CSS interacted with the page's CSS. 
Version 1.5: Addressed this issue. What was then the issue is that the javacript is just aweful. 
Version 2: This was fixed by extracting the javascript and serving it via an MVC site call. 
Version 3: TBC (what we ant to build in production) - this will use Vue.js to handle the UI served by a webapi backend and using the shadow root as found to be the way forwad in the previous versions.

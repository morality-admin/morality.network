# Morality 1.0 

This project serves as playground for some of our ideas. It also serves as a baseline for our final application/s. At the moment, this is written in .NET 4.5.2 but the final application will be in .NET Core 3.0. This will be completed upon the release and not before so we can make use of EF6.

This is by no means all of our code base and is not the limit of our research and prototype implementation. This is a playground to test out some ideas and get most of the components out that can be reused (once converted) in later application implementation. There is no guarantee any of this work at the point at which it is downloaded. This is spoken about above, a work in progress.
